## You are a developer proficient with laravel/php/html/css/js ?
- You are a backend developer with experience of the Laravel framework: add new features, fix bug, write tests, document everything. I happily accept pull requests if they pass unit tests and follow the project philosophy
- You are a frontend developer with experience of the Laravel framework: the current UI is not pretty, make it brilliant. Fix UX as you see fit. I happily accept pull requests if they pass unit tests and follow the project philosophy. We don't want the project to become a one page app powered by the latest "Ã  la mode" js framework.
- If you have some time to give to this project, there are already some issues to fix (see. https://github.com/philippejadin/agorakit/issues). Whether you have one hour per day or one hour per month, help is really appreciated! And remember, "talk is silver, code is gold" :-)
- Let's talk in the issue queue if your idea involves big changes.

Make a branch of the master branch, work on your branch and create a pull request when ready. See http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html

## Financial support
- Consider donating to help me work on it (check https://agorakit.org)
- Help me find ways to support financially the project (sponsorship, public subsidies, etc.)
- Financial support is btw the key to offer a free hosted version in the future for those groups that can't afford to pay. This is high on my todo list
