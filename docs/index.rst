Welcome to Agorakit's documentation!
====================================

Agorakit is an open source and web based groupware for collectives to communicate, organize and store their files. It keeps everyone updated in your collaborative group with a discuss forum, agenda for events, file manager and email notifier. And, most of the time, Agorakit doesn't need an admin, keeping the process as horizontal as possible.
