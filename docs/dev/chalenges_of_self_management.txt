How to cope with spam and bad behaving people in self managed groups ?

Ideas for the system

We already have multiple level in the membership :

* 20 people joined and confirmed email
* -10 people don't want any news from us
* -20 people is blacklisted (?) probably for spam

-> create a new membership level for confirmed people. People are confirmed when a few members confirmed they are real.

Or a point system
