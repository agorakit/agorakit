## Agorakit, groupware for citizens

AgoraKit is web-based, open-source groupware for citizens' initiatives. By creating collaborative groups, people can discuss topics, organize events, store files and keep everyone updated as needed. AgoraKit is a forum, calendar, file manager and email notifier.

Manage communication, decision making, membership, files and events. Flexible email notifications per group, per user preferences. Most of the time, no admin is involved in the process as we try to keep it as horizontal as possible.

In other words: an organized Facebook for the paranoid inside all of us.
